# Decay Configuration
# Defines how relationship score decays over time per chapter

# Grace periods before decay starts (in hours)
# After this time without interaction, decay begins
grace_periods:
  1: 8    # Chapter 1: High pressure - 8 hours
  2: 16   # Chapter 2: Still demanding - 16 hours
  3: 24   # Chapter 3: Standard day - 24 hours
  4: 48   # Chapter 4: More forgiving - 48 hours
  5: 72   # Chapter 5: Most forgiving - 72 hours

# Decay rates per chapter (percentage per HOUR after grace period)
# Decreasing as relationship matures
decay_rates:
  1: 0.8   # Chapter 1: Harshest - 0.8%/hour
  2: 0.6   # Chapter 2: -0.6%/hour
  3: 0.4   # Chapter 3: -0.4%/hour
  4: 0.3   # Chapter 4: -0.3%/hour
  5: 0.2   # Chapter 5: Most forgiving - 0.2%/hour

# Daily decay caps (max decay in 24 hours after grace)
daily_caps:
  1: 12.0   # Max 12% loss per day
  2: 10.0   # Max 10% loss per day
  3: 8.0    # Max 8% loss per day
  4: 6.0    # Max 6% loss per day
  5: 4.0    # Max 4% loss per day

# Decay schedule
schedule:
  # How often to check for decay (pg_cron interval)
  check_interval_minutes: 60

  # Minimum time between decay applications for same user
  min_decay_interval_minutes: 60
