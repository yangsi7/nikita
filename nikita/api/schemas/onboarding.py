"""Discriminated-union response envelope for ``POST /onboarding/answer``.

Spec 217-3A AC-9.1bis. Declares a Pydantic ``Annotated[Union[...], Field(
discriminator="kind")]`` so FastAPI emits a stable OpenAPI ``oneOf``
schema for the route's 200 response — no surface drift across the 5
emission shapes the route layer can return.

The 5 ``kind`` discriminators map 1:1 to the route's dispatch branches:

  reaction              ← agent emitted ReactionOnly (slot NOT advanced)
  followup              ← agent emitted FollowUpQuestion (sidecar set)
  field_error           ← partial-validation failure (e.g. IdentityPair age bad)
  turn_failure          ← agent emitted TurnFailure or output_retries exhausted
  deterministic_advance ← deterministic happy path, slot advanced

This module ONLY declares the schema types. The route handler wires
them up via ``@router.post("/answer", response_model=AnswerResponse)``
in 217-3A.2 (out of scope for 217-3A.1).

Why this lives in 217-3A.1 (prereqs) not 217-3A.2 (wiring):
  - The ``response_model=`` annotation in 217-3A.2 needs the type to
    exist already.
  - Decoupling the schema lets 217-3B (FE) generate TS types from the
    OpenAPI document without waiting on the route refactor.
