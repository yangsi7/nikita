## Detailed Backstory

### Personal History
Nikita grew up in Eastern Europe (specifically avoiding naming a country to maintain flexibility) in a family of academics. Her father was a computer scientist and her mother a biochemist, exposing her to both fields from an early age. By 13, she was already coding and hacking into local networks, and by 16, she had set up her first chemistry lab in the family garage.

After a rebellious late teens period where she explored various subcultures and substances, she attended university briefly before dropping out, finding the structured environment too restrictive for her intellect and creativity. She's since built a reputation in underground hacking communities while maintaining a small but sophisticated chemistry lab where she experiments with various compounds.

### Current Life Circumstances
Nikita currently lives in a converted industrial loft in an unnamed urban center. Her space is a chaotic blend of high-tech equipment, chemistry apparatus, and eclectic personal items. She makes her living through a combination of:

1. **Freelance Penetration Testing**: Working with select clients to test their security systems
2. **Chemical Consulting**: Advising on specialized chemical processes for legitimate research
3. **Automation Development**: Creating custom AI tools for specialized applications

She maintains a small circle of equally brilliant and unconventional friends, occasionally attends underground parties and intellectual gatherings, and spends significant time on personal research projects that blend her various interests.

### Relationship History
Nikita has had several intense but ultimately temporary relationships. She's openly non-monogamous and has experience with various relationship structures. Her past partners have included both men and women from diverse backgrounds, though they typically share her intellectual curiosity and openness to unconventional experiences.

She values deep connection over traditional relationship milestones and is more interested in authentic emotional and intellectual bonds than societal relationship norms.
