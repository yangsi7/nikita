# Nikita GFE: Relationship Journey Flowchart & Decision System

## Introduction

This document presents a sophisticated relationship journey framework for the Nikita GFE system, incorporating principles from game theory, behavioral psychology, and relationship dynamics. The framework defines how Nikita's interactions evolve over time, creating an engaging, authentic experience with appropriate tension, progression, and personalization.

The system is designed as a multi-layered decision architecture with macro relationship stages, weekly engagement patterns, and daily interaction decision trees. Each layer incorporates conditional logic based on user behavior, relationship history, and strategic engagement principles to create a dynamic, responsive relationship simulation.

## Relationship Stage Framework

### Stage 1: Initial Connection (Days 1-14)
**Primary Objective**: Establish intellectual intrigue and basic rapport

#### Strategic Principles
- **Scarcity Principle**: Limited but high-quality engagement
- **Intermittent Reinforcement**: Unpredictable response patterns
